Regression project IPL score Prediction

 step-by-step instructions:

1. **Setup Google Colab:**
   - Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Create a new Python 3 notebook.

2. **Import Libraries:**
   - Copy and paste the import statements at the beginning of your Colab notebook to import the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, keras, tensorflow, ipywidgets, etc.

3. **Upload Data:**
   - Upload the IPL dataset file ('ipl_data.csv') to your Google Colab environment. You can do this by clicking on the 'Files' tab on the left sidebar and then uploading the file.

4. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training:**
   - Copy and paste the code for data preprocessing, feature scaling, defining the neural network model, compiling the model, and training the model using the IPL dataset. Ensure that you run this code block to preprocess the data and train the model.

5. **Create Interactive Widget:**
   - Copy and paste the code for creating the interactive widget using ipywidgets. This includes creating dropdown widgets for venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, bowler, and a button widget to predict the score.
   - Also, copy and paste the code for the `predict_score` function that performs the prediction based on user input and displays the predicted score.

6. **Run the Widget:**
   - Run the code block containing the interactive widget and prediction function.
   - Select the values for venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, and bowler using the dropdown widgets.
   - Click on the "Predict Score" button to see the predicted score displayed.

7. **Test the Prediction:**
   - Test the prediction by selecting different values for venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, and bowler and checking if the predicted scores are reasonable.

8. **Save the Colab Notebook:**
   - After testing and verifying the prediction functionality, save the Colab notebook.
   - Click on File -> Save a copy in GitHub.
   - Select the repository where you want to save the notebook and provide a name for the notebook.
   - This will save the notebook to your GitHub repository.

9. **Update README File:**
   - Open the README file in your GitHub repository.
   - Add a section describing the IPL score prediction project.
   - Provide a brief overview of the project, including the goal (predicting cricket scores using deep learning), the dataset used, and the technologies/libraries involved.
   - Include instructions for running the prediction widget in Google Colab (mention the interactive dropdowns and the "Predict Score" button).
   - Optionally, you can add screenshots or GIFs demonstrating how to use the interactive widget for prediction.

10. **Commit Changes:**
    - Once you have updated the README file, commit the changes to your GitHub repository.
    - Add a meaningful commit message describing the updates related to the IPL score prediction project.

By following these steps, you can create an IPL score prediction project using deep learning in Google Colab and document it in your GitHub repository's README file for others to understand and use.
